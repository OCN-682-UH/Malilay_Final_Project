      Abstract: 
        Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) of Guam, including National Parks, 
        National Marine Sanctuaries, National Wildlife Refuges, ecological 
        reserves, and Territorial Seashore Parks. Compiled from multiple 
        sources, including the National Park Service (NPS), National Marine 
        Sanctuaries (NMS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), World Database of 
        Protected Areas (WDPA), Guam Bureau of Statistics and Plans (BSP), and 
        the Guam Coastal Management Program (GCMP). For use in planning 
        purposes only, not for use in litigation.
      Purpose: 
        PacIOOS provides timely, reliable, and accurate ocean information to 
        support a safe, clean, productive ocean and resilient coastal zone in 
        the U.S. Pacific Islands region.
